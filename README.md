# SpacePilot
## Overview
Space Pilot is a 2D space runner game made using Unity. In the game, players travel through a dangerous asteroid world in open space. The goal is to avoid the asteroids and safely reach your space station.
## Game Objective
The main goal of Space Pilot is to reach the space station by traveling through a field of asteroids. The player has 3 lives, which are lost by crashing into asteroids. To help survive, the player can use bullets to shoot and destroy asteroids in the way. There is also a boost power-up that lets the player move quickly.
## Key Features
### Asteroid Field: The game is set in deep space, filled with moving asteroids that the player must avoid or destroy to survive.
### Boost Mechanic: A special boost lets the player move faster through dangerous areas. However, it can only be used once the player has more than 10 XP.
### Shooting System: The player can shoot bullets to break asteroids and clear the path. This adds action and gives the player more control during tough situations.
### Lives System: The player starts with 3 lives. Crashing into asteroids causes the player to lose a life. Losing all lives ends the game.
### Space Theme: The game has a dark space setting, filled with asteroids and stars. The space station at the end of the level is designed to look like a giant whale, giving the game a unique and creative look.
## How to Play
### Movement: Use the arrow keys to move the spaceship. Press the space bar to activate the boost. Use Left Ctrl or left-click to shoot bullets and destroy asteroids.
### Objective: Travel through the asteroid field and reach the space station safely. Avoid crashing into asteroids and manage your 3 lives carefully.
### Power-Up: The boost becomes available once your XP is over 10 or more and it grows overtime.
### Game Over: The game ends if you lose all 3 lives by crashing into asteroids.
### Level Complete: You complete the level once you successfully reach the space station

## Challenges Faced:
This was my first full project in Unity, so I had to learn a lot as I went. There were many times I had to try things again and again to make them work.
One big challenge was getting the space rover's up and down movement animations to play properly. At first, the animations didn’t show at all when the rover moved. It took me a lot of time to fix the problem and link the animation to the right movement.
Setting up the boost was also tricky. I had to work hard to make it look and feel right. Placing the asteroids in the right spots was difficult too—I had to make sure they made the game fun and challenging without being too hard.
Adding features like shooting and keeping track of lives also took time. I had to make sure all parts of the game worked well together without bugs.
